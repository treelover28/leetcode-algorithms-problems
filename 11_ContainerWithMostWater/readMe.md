## Problem Statement

Given n __non-negative integers__ a<sup>1</sup>, a<sup>2</sup>, ..., a<sup>n</sup> , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, a<sup>i</sup>). 
__n__ vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, a<sup>i</sup>) and (i, 0). 
Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and __n is at least 2__.

 



The above vertical lines are represented by array ```[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]```. 
In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

__Example:__
```
Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
```
