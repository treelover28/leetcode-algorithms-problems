## Problem Statement

Given the ```root``` node of a binary search tree, return the sum of values of all nodes with value between ```L``` and ```R``` __(inclusive).__

The binary search tree is guaranteed to have __unique values.__

__Example 1:__
```
Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,null,18], L = 7, R = 15
Output: 32
```

__Example 2:__
```
Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,13,18,1,null,6], L = 6, R = 10
Output: 23
```

__Note:__

* The number of nodes in the tree is __at most 10000__.
* The final answer is guaranteed to be less than __2<sup>31</sup>__.

## Result
My solutions beats:
* 100.00% all Java submissions running-time wise
* 95.15% all Java submissions memory-usage wise.
* __O(n)__
