## Problem Statement

Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target. 
Return the __sum of the three integers__. You may assume that each input would have __exactly one solution__.

__Example:__
```
Given array nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], and target = 1.

The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
```
