## Problem Statement ##

Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that **a + b + c = 0?**
Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Note:

The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

Example:
```
Given array nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]
```
## Result
Solution beats:
* 80.85% of all Java submission running-speed wise
* 99.93% of all Java submission memory-usage wise
* O(n<sup>2</sup>)
