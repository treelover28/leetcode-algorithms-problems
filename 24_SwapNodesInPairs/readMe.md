## Problem Statement

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.

You __may not modify the values in the list's nodes__, only nodes itself may be changed.

 

Example:

```
Given 1->2->3->4, you should return the list as 2->1->4->3.
```

## Result
I solve this problem using both an iterative approach and a recursive approach
### Iterative:
My iterative approach beats:
* 100% of all Java submissions running-time wise
* 100% of all Java submissions memory-usage wise
* O(n)

### Recursive
My recursive approach (well, honestly, I couldn't figure out how to do recursion at first, so I look at some of the sample solutions, my current solution is "overwhelmingly inspired" from them) beats:
* 100% of all Java submissions running-time wise
* 100% of all Java submissions memory-usage wise
* O(n)
