## Problem Statement

Given a binary tree, flatten it to a linked list in-place.

For example, given the following tree:
```
    1
   / \
  2   5
 / \   \
3   4   6
```
The flattened tree should look like:
```
1
 \
  2
   \
    3
     \
      4
       \
        5
         \
          6
```

## Result:
My algorithm beats:
* 50.23% of all other Java submissions running-time wise.
* 98.31% of all other Java submissions memory-usage wise.
* O(n)
